## Installing

Home Assistant has several installation / running methods. Many people have
different opinions and their personal favorites. Each method has its
advantages and disadvantages. Important to know, there is no wrong, or right here,
each technique installs the **SAME** Home Assistant.

Home Assistant currently _recommends_ the Hass.io method.

- [Hass.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/) - Installing using a Docker managed environment (recommended method).
- [Docker](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/docker/) - Installing on Docker.
- [Manually](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/virtualenv/) - Manual installation using a Python virtual environment.

## In case you need help

It doesn't matter if you have a question, need help, want to request a feature,
or just say ‚ÄòHi‚Äô._
