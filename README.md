Home Assistant is an open source home automation that puts local control and
privacy first. Powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY
enthusiasts. Perfect to run on a Raspberry Pi or a local server.

If you want to get an impression on the look and feel,
you should check out the [Home Assistant online demo](https://demo.home-assistant.io).

Awesome Trend Community is a curated list of awesome
[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) resources.
Additional software, tutorials, custom components, Hassio add-ons,

## Installing

Home Assistant has several installation / running methods. Many people have
different opinions and their personal favorites. Each method has its
advantages and disadvantages. Important to know, there is no wrong, or right here,
each technique installs the **SAME** Home Assistant.

Home Assistant currently _recommends_ the Hass.io method.

- [Hass.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/) - Installing using a Docker managed environment (recommended method).
- [Docker](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/docker/) - Installing on Docker.
- [Manually](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/virtualenv/) - Manual installation using a Python virtual environment.
